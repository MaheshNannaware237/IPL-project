## 📌 Key Features

- Display basic information using `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Team-wise total runs analysis
- Average and maximum run calculations using NumPy
- Visualizations:
  - Bar Chart: Total runs by each team
  - Pie Chart: Team-wise run contributions

## 📚 How to Use

1. Download the dataset from the link above.
2. Open the Colab notebook (`ipl_analysis.ipynb`).
3. Upload the dataset in Colab.
4. Run all cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
